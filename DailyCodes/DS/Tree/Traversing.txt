	Traversing is the process by which we can visit and access each and every element present in any data structure like array, linkedList, or tree

	Tree Traversal :-

		Actually there are many ways but we are going for 5 of them

		1] DFS
			
			a] Preorder	= Node, Left, Right
			b] InOrder	= Left, Node, Right
			c] Postorder	= Left, Right, Node

		2] BFS
			
			a] Level order
			b] Vertical Order
